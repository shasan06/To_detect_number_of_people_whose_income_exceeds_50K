To_detect_number_of_people_whose_income_exceeds_50K_by_using_WAME_optimiser_to_increase_effieciency_on_adult_dataset

# Action
Implemented the neural network training algorithm described in the paper, called WAME, and test it on a real-world data set. Describe how the method works, adjust its free parameters, discussing experimental set up and explaining experiments. Lastly, have to evaluate how the algorithm solves the problem, and discuss the results and their significance.

# Result
Use the confusion matriox to calculate the percentage of the number of people whose income exceeds 50K.
Used one hot encoding to convert the string data to integers
Used the Weightâ€“wise Adaptive Learning Rates optimiser inplace of Adam to compare the efficiency of the model
As a result secured a distinction on this project
